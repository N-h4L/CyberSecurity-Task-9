# Cyber Security Internship – Task 9

## 📌 Task Title
Network Vulnerability Scanning

## 🛠 Tool Used
- Nmap

## 🎯 Objective
To understand network reconnaissance techniques by scanning a local network, identifying open ports, detecting services, and analyzing potential security risks using Nmap.

## 📚 Task Overview
This task focuses on performing basic network vulnerability scanning in a controlled lab environment.  
Nmap was used to discover active hosts, scan TCP ports, attempt service and operating system detection, and interpret the security posture of the target system.

All scans were performed only on authorized systems for educational purposes.

## 🧪 Scanning Environment
- Operating System: Kali Linux
- Network Type: Local / Private Network
- Scanning Tool: Nmap

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Understanding port scanning and host discovery
- Identifying open, closed, and filtered ports
- Service and OS enumeration using Nmap
- Interpreting scan results from a security perspective
- Importance of network reconnaissance in cyber security

## 🛡 Risk Interpretation
The scan results indicated that the target host was active but had no open TCP ports.  
This configuration reduces the attack surface and reflects good security hardening practices.

## ✅ Learning Outcome
- Practical experience with Nmap
- Improved network reconnaissance skills
- Ability to analyze and document network security findings professionally

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All scanning activities were conducted in a controlled lab environment on systems owned by the user. No unauthorized networks or real-world targets were scanned.
